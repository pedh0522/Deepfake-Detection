# Deepfake-Detection
Deepfake Detection with Vision Transformer and Chain Classifier
Description
This project aims to detect deepfake images using a Vision Transformer (ViT) model and a chain classifier. The Vision Transformer model is utilized to extract features from images, which are then fed into a chain classifier to identify which model generated the fake image.

Installation
To run the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)
Pandas (pip install pandas)
CLIP (pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git)
PyTorch (pip install torch)
NumPy (pip install numpy)
scikit-learn (pip install scikit-learn)
TensorFlow (pip install tensorflow)
Additionally, you will need access to Google Colab for model training and execution.

Usage
Mount Google Drive: Run the provided code in a Google Colab notebook to mount your Google Drive for data storage and access.
Install Dependencies: Install the required dependencies using the provided commands.
Load and Preprocess Images: Images are loaded, preprocessed (Gaussian blur and JPEG compression), and encoded using the CLIP model.
Train Linear Classifier: Train a linear classifier using the extracted features to distinguish between real and fake images.
Train SVM and Random Forest Models: Train support vector machine (SVM) and random forest models for each dataset generated by the chain classifier.
Train Neural Network Models: Train neural network models for each dataset generated by the chain classifier.
Evaluate Models: Evaluate the performance of the trained models on the test set using accuracy metrics.
Features
Utilizes Vision Transformer (ViT) model for feature extraction.
Implements a chain classifier to identify the source of fake images.
Supports training and evaluation of linear classifiers, SVMs, random forests, and neural networks.
